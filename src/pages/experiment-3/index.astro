        <h1>Experiment 3</h1>
        <p>
            I feel like I really want to get markdown content working, but it
            feels like slightly more trouble than it is worth.
        </p>
        <p>
            In preparation for this experiemnt, I have added two audio files to
            the project that I will use to play with the tone.js sampler. These files are two long ambient demos called "4pos" and "Bathing Hands". The experiment will follow this basic order of operations:
            <ol>
                <li>Randomly select one of the two files</li>
                <li>Find a random 5-second fragment of the file and assign it to a new Tone.Player</li>
                <li>Start the player with a fadein</li>
                <li>After 2 minutes, fade the player to infinity and stop the player</li>
            </ol>
            This will be repeated every 45 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            This does produce some very nice ambient results.  There is some trickiness I do not yet understand with the Player.fadeIn and .fadeOut options and how those interact with playback. There is no cross-fade looping available with these players, so there are going to be noticible clicks when the players loop unless we get lucky with the start point.
        </p>

        <p>For some additional continuity, I pipe the players through a Reverb. </p>
        <p>Note that it can take a few moments for audio to begin as the audio file is loaded by the player.  You can watch the activity of the players loading in the console.</p>
